# Reflections – 1st Quarter Portfolio

## 1. Topics I Know Very Well
1. **Introduction to Web Development**  
   I clearly understood the course requirements and the tools needed such as GitHub and VSCode. Creating my first portfolio repository and enabling GitHub Pages helped me see how web services can be deployed. This gave me confidence in using development tools effectively.  

2. **Variables and Data Types in JavaScript**  
   I know how to declare variables and use primitive data types such as strings, numbers, and booleans. I also understand how to apply logical, arithmetic, and comparison operations, which are essential in solving programming problems.  

3. **Control Structures**  
   Using `if-else` and looping structures became easy for me after practice. I can apply branching to control the program flow depending on conditions, which makes my code more flexible.  

4. **Basic HTML Structure**  
   I can create simple webpages using basic HTML tags such as `<p>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, and layout tags like `<header>` and `<footer>`. This made me realize how important structure is in organizing webpage content.  

5. **Applying Basic CSS**  
   I understand how to apply styles using selectors, properties for text, fonts, and backgrounds. CSS allowed me to make my webpage more visually appealing and organized.

## 2. Topics I Need More Practice On
1. **Number Methods in JavaScript**  
   While I know how to use methods like `parseInt()` and `toFixed()`, I sometimes forget the correct usage and when to apply them.  

2. **Node.js and Express**  
   Creating a simple web service was a challenge because it requires a deeper understanding of servers and modules. I need more exposure to backend concepts.  

3. **Debugging Techniques**  
   I still struggle with identifying errors quickly using the browser’s Inspect tool. Sometimes it takes me too long to fix small mistakes.  

4. **Event Handlers in JavaScript**  
   While I know the basic concept, I still need practice in applying event triggers correctly within HTML documents.  

5. **Integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
   Combining all three languages in one project is still difficult for me. I get confused on how to properly organize the code between structure, style, and behavior.

## 3. My Plan of Action
1. Practice more exercises on **Number Methods** to strengthen recall and application.  
2. Watch tutorials and read documentation on **Node.js and Express** to gain a clearer understanding of backend programming.  
3. Use debugging tools more frequently and intentionally practice solving errors to become faster.  
4. Create small projects with **Event Handlers** (e.g., button clicks, form validation) to master usage.  
5. Build mini-projects that integrate **HTML, CSS, and JS** together, starting from simple ones and gradually increasing complexity.

## 4. Effective and Ineffective Activities
- **Effective Activities:**  
  1. The graded exercises (like using variables and control structures) were effective because they gave me hands-on practice.  
  2. Creating the GitHub portfolio repository was helpful because I could see my work live and track my progress.  

- **Ineffective Activities:**  
  1. Some non-graded exercises felt less effective since I wasn’t motivated to complete them seriously.  
  2. I feel like I didn’t prepare enough for the long test.
